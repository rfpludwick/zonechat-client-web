# ZoneChat Web Client

This is the web client for the ZoneChat application. In its current state, it is
an extremely simple frontend for the server. Eventually it will be a Typescript
& React application.

The ZoneChat application was originally a small project I embarked upon to learn
more about websockets while practicing Go. I kept adding things to it to either
practice or learn, and I decided to finally learn more about React and to dive
into Typescript a little bit as well.
